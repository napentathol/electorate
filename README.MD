# Introduction

This project is intended to create a simulator for various electoral systems to programmatically validate the efficacy
of various electoral systems as measured by "regret".

# Calculation of Regret

"Regret" is here calculated by the difference between the utility of the best societal candidate and the utility of the
candidate selected by the electoral system.
